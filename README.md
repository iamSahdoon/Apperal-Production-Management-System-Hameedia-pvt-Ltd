# Apparel Management System for Hameedia

## Problem Definition
The current manual system at Hameedia lacks automation for monitoring the production process. This leads to time-consuming and error-prone target setting for employees, based on manually recorded attendance. The lack of visibility into the production process hinders efficient management of production lines and customer order updates. Moreover, the entire team is vulnerable to errors introduced by customers during the manual order process.

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to implement an apparel management system that automates processes and provides real-time visibility into the production process. The system aims to optimize resource allocation, improve productivity and efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction.

## Proposed Solution
Our team proposes an apparel management system that automates the processes of tracking progress, setting employee targets, and balancing production lines. The system will provide real-time visibility into the production process, enabling efficient and productive workflow management. It will improve productivity by assigning tasks based on each employee's skill set and performance, leading to an optimized production process. The system will also balance production lines through effective resource allocation, resulting in higher productivity and lower costs. This improved resource allocation will ensure timely completion of all orders, thereby increasing customer satisfaction. Overall, this solution aims to help Hameedia achieve higher efficiency, productivity, and customer satisfaction.
